> DiscordConsole is software aiming to give you full control over accounts, bots and webhooks!

**Note: Current version of DiscordConsole is messy and is therefore being rewritten.
Sadly the rewrite is stuck because of an upstream dependency.**

### Install

To get started, simply [download the console from releases](https://github.com/discordconsole-team/DiscordConsole/releases).

Or compile it yourself: `go get github.com/discordconsole-team/DiscordConsole`, you'll also need the DiscordGo development version; to get that type `make dgo`. Finally, just type `go install`

### Usage

It is recommended to run DiscordConsole in a Terminal. To do that, just `cd` to the folder you extracted it and run it by typing `DiscordConsole`. There are a few launch options. You can display them by running DiscordConsole with `-h`.

When starting the DiscordConsole in Windows for the first time, you might get a screen saying that Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Just click **More Info** and then **Run anyway**.

Once started, you'll get asked to fill in your token. If you don't know how to get it, check [this wiki page](https://discordconsole-team.github.io/Wiki/wiki.html).
For the first setup, we will use an user account. Setups with bot accounts and webhook are explained on the [wiki](https://discordconsole-team.github.io/Wiki/wiki.html) as well.

Once you got your token, just type `user <token>` in the terminal. You'll get the following screen:

Try to type something like `help` and let the magic happen! For a detailed review of each command, type `help command`.
