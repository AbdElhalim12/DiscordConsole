Type "help" at the prompt for a full list of commands.

## Special features
Set playing status, simulate typing, bulk delete and more.

### Bulk delete
DiscordConsole lets you BULK DELETE messages. This allows you to delete a bunch of messages at once, without needing to write any code!

### Log
Log the last 100 messages to a file, or just view the last 10 in directly in the console!

## Command line
DiscordConsole has full command line support. You can supply a bot token or email/password on the command line, and even specify commands to run, so you can use DiscordConsole for scripting.

Having it start with a specific server automatically selected? Making a cron job to automatically message how many days until Trump leaves? Easy!

## Cross platform
This program works and will always work on Mac, Linux and Windows.

# Have fun!
That is the most important of all.
