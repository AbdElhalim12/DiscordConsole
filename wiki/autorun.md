# AutoRun
A `.autorun` file is a very easy way to automatically run commands in DiscordConsole, without needing a shell script.

First, create the file.  
Second, just create the commands.  

And example `.autorun` may look like this:  
```
guild 123
channel 321
```
.

## Tokens
Autorun files can also automatically sign you in!  
The **first** line has to be a colon (`:`) and your token!  
(Remember, if it's a user token, you need `user` before the token.)
