# DiscordConsole... Selfbot?
Did you know, DiscordConsole can be a selfbot?  
Well, it's true.  

Simply write the command prefixed by `console.` as the account you're logged in to.  
You will quickly learn this is a good way to save time.

If you hate saving time, we'll show you how to get rid of it. But first.. Examples!

## Examples:
You can send all these as discord messages.  
The console will change channel for you.  

`console.say Hello!`  
`console.big HELLO!!!`
`console.quote 123454321` (Pretend 123454321 is a message ID)  
`console.run potato.lua` (Pretend potato.lua is a LUA script)  

## Disabling it?
Hate saving time, do you? Well, ok, I'll show you how.  
Run `disableintercept` in the console, or in a bash or autorun script.  
Yes, that's literally it.

If you regret your desicion, and want to start saving time again, just run `enableintercept`.
